# DriverPass

For this project, we will create a system for our client, DriverPass. They want to offer the cummunity better driving training. Through their system, their customers will have access to classes, practice test, and driving lessons. I am very satesfied with the different diagrams I created that help give the process and system a better understanding. The diagrams are great visuals for the client and software developers. I would revise the nonfunctional requirements by adding more detail, such as adding a 2-step authentication when logging in. When looking at the user's needs, I gathered the request that they wanted in the system. Then I organized it by what was possible to add and rank each request by necessity. After that, I added added them into the requirements for the system. I think this is important because the system is specifically for the client. We should be trying to add what they request that is within our limits. I think I would approach designing software with more confidence after learning all the different steps and requirements. In the future, I would create a good software design document because you can have other experienced users who can review your design and it keeps everyone on the same page. I also like the different UML diagrams. I think it gives an alternative way to explain your system.
